## Troubleshooting

### Extension Won't Load

**Problem:** Extension doesn't appear in the extensions list
**Solutions:**
- Make sure you're using Chrome (not other browsers)
- Check that Developer mode is enabled
- Verify the folder contains `manifest.json`
- Try refreshing the extensions page

**Problem:** "This extension may be corrupted" error
**Solutions:**
- Re-download the extension files
- Make sure all files are present
- Check that `manifest.json` is valid

### API Key Issues

**Problem:** "I need your OpenAI API key" message
**Solutions:**
- Make sure your API key starts with `sk-`
- Check that you have OpenAI credits
- Try pasting the key again
- Verify the key is complete (no missing characters)

**Problem:** API requests failing
**Solutions:**
- Check your OpenAI account has credits
- Verify the API key is correct
- Check your internet connection
- Try generating a new API key

### Page Context Not Working

**Problem:** AI doesn't see the current page
**Solutions:**
- Refresh the page after installing the extension
- Make sure you're not on a chrome:// page
- Check the browser console for errors
- Try asking "What page am I on?" again

**Problem:** "Extension context invalidated" errors
**Solutions:**
- Reload the extension in `chrome://extensions/`
- Refresh the current page
- This should be fixed in v2.1

### Documentation Crawling Issues

**Problem:** URLs not being crawled
**Solutions:**
- Some URLs may be blocked by CORS policies
- Try using different documentation URLs
- Check that URLs are publicly accessible
- Make sure URLs start with `http://` or `https://`

**Problem:** "Cannot access browser internal URL" error
**Solutions:**
- This is normal for chrome:// URLs
- Use public URLs instead
- The extension will skip these automatically

## Advanced Configuration

### Customizing the Extension

#### Changing the API Model
To use a different OpenAI model, edit `content-script.js`:
```javascript
// In the callOpenAI method, change:
model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo'
// To:
model: 'gpt-4' // or other available models
```

#### Adjusting Content Limits
To change how much page content is analyzed:
```javascript
// In the getPageContext method, change:
let visibleText = bodyText.substring(0, 2000);
// To:
let visibleText = bodyText.substring(0, 5000); // for more content
```

#### Modifying UI Styling
Edit the CSS in the `addStyles()` method in `content-script.js` to customize the appearance.

### Updating the Extension

#### Manual Update
1. Download the latest version
2. Replace the old files with new ones
3. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
4. Click the refresh button on the extension
5. Refresh any open pages

#### Automatic Update (Future)
When published to Chrome Web Store, updates will be automatic.

## Security Considerations

### API Key Security
- **Never share your API key** with others
- **Don't commit API keys** to version control
- **Use environment variables** for development
- **Rotate keys regularly** for security

### Data Privacy

- **Local processing** - All processing happens in your browser
- **Secure communication** - All API calls use HTTPS
- **No tracking** - No user tracking or analytics

### Permissions
The extension requires these permissions:
- **activeTab** - To read the current page content
- **storage** - To save your API key (in memory only)
- **tabs** - To communicate between components
- **scripting** - To inject the content script
