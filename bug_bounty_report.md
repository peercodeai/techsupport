## Issue #1: Chat Bubble Not Opening & Content Script Loading

**Description:** The chat bubble, which is the primary UI for the extension, was not appearing on web pages. This was linked to the content script not properly initializing the `ChatBubbleAssistant` and the necessary JavaScript files from the `popup` directory not being loaded within the content script's context.

**Root Cause:**
1.  The `ChatBubbleAssistant` class, defined in `popup/popup.js`, was not being instantiated or used within `content/content-script.js`.
2.  The JavaScript files located in the `popup/` directory (e.g., `popup.js`, `status-monitor.js`, `file-handler.js`, `url-monitor.js`, `chat-handler.js`) were not explicitly included in the `content_scripts` section of `manifest.json` to be injected into the web page.

**Proposed Solution:**
1.  **Instantiate `ChatBubbleAssistant` in `content-script.js`:** Modified `content/content-script.js` to create an instance of `ChatBubbleAssistant` when the extension is initialized. This ensures the chat bubble UI is rendered and its functionality is active.
2.  **Include `popup` scripts in `manifest.json`:** Updated `manifest.json` to include all relevant JavaScript files from the `popup/` directory in the `content_scripts` section. This ensures that all necessary components for the chat bubble are loaded and available in the web page's context.

**Files Modified:**
- `content/content-script.js`
- `manifest.json`

**Verification Steps (Simulated):**
- After applying the fix, the `ChatBubbleAssistant` should be initialized, and its `init()` method should be called, leading to the chat bubble being appended to the `document.body`.
- The console logs from `popup.js` (e.g., "Chat Bubble Assistant initialized successfully") should appear in the browser's console, indicating successful loading and initialization of the chat bubble.

## Next Steps:
Further testing would involve loading the modified extension in a Chrome browser and verifying that the chat bubble appears and functions as expected on various websites. This includes testing:
- Dragging functionality
- API key input and connection
- Documentation URL input and crawling
- Message sending and receiving
- History navigation
