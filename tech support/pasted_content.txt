# Tech Support Browser Extension - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary
A browser extension that automatically monitors network activity, detects technical issues in real-time, and provides intelligent troubleshooting assistance through an integrated chatbot interface powered by documentation search.

## Product Vision
Transform technical support from reactive ticket-based resolution to proactive, context-aware assistance that resolves issues before users even realize they exist.

## Core Features

### 1. Real-time Network Monitoring
- **Background Analysis**: Continuously monitor fetch/XHR requests across all tabs
- **Error Detection**: Automatic identification of failed requests, timeouts, and API issues
- **Smart Filtering**: Focus on application-relevant traffic, ignore analytics/tracking
- **Performance Metrics**: Track response times, payload sizes, and connection issues

### 2. Contextual Issue Detection
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify common failure signatures (404s, 500s, CORS, timeouts)
- **Domain Intelligence**: Understand which domains/APIs are critical vs. auxiliary
- **Error Correlation**: Link multiple related failures to single root causes
- **Proactive Alerts**: Notify users of issues before they impact workflow

### 3. Integrated Chat Assistant
- **Floating Widget**: Non-intrusive overlay with expand/collapse functionality
- **Context-Aware**: Pre-populate chat with detected network issues and relevant data
- **Visual Network Inspector**: Built-in network tab showing filtered, relevant requests
- **Solution Overlay**: Display fixes directly on problematic web pages

### 4. Extension Architecture
- **Manifest V3 Compliance**: Modern extension architecture with service workers
- **Multi-browser Support**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge compatibility
- **Minimal Permissions**: Request only necessary permissions with clear justification
- **Offline Capability**: Cache solutions for common issues when network is unavailable

2. Pre-populated chat with detected issues and context
3. AI analyzes network data and searches solutions
4. Interactive troubleshooting with visual overlays on page

### 3. Proactive Prevention
1. Extension learns user's workflow patterns
2. Predicts potential issues based on network behavior
3. Suggests preventive actions or alternative approaches
4. Provides performance optimization recommendations

## Extension-Specific Features

### 1. Smart Network Capture
